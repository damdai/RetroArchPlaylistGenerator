# RetroArchPlaylistGenerator
A command-line utility to generate RetroArch playlists from local ROM directories.

Utilizes Lucene.Net to match ROM filenames to those found in the RetroArch databases. 
This performs significantly better than RetroArch's built in scanner, achieving a greater match rate in less time.

Run from a Command Prompt without any arguments for instructions.
